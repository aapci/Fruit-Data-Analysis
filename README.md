# Fruit-Data-Analysis
This project presents a visualization of fruit sales data in Power BI, inspired by a tutorial on YouTube. The analysis focuses on exploring the quantity, price, and sales of different fruits, as well as the purchasing behavior of customers.
The visualization is presented in a Power BI dashboard, which includes multiple charts and tables that allow users to interact with the data and explore different insights. The charts are designed with a colorful and playful style, reflecting the nature of the fruit data.

In addition, the dashboard includes three cards that summarize the total sales, discount given, and quantity sold across all products.

This project can be useful for anyone interested in analyzing sales data, such as grocery stores, marketplaces, or data analysts. The code is written in DAX and can be adapted to different datasets or business needs.

The data used for this analysis is provided in a CSV file, which can be found in the data folder. The Power BI report file is located in the report folder.

Special thanks to the YouTube channel that provided the inspiration and guidance for this project. Their tutorial was a valuable resource for learning how to create data visualizations in Power BI.

Feel free to download, use, and modify this project for your own purposes. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
